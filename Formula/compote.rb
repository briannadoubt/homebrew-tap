  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Compote requires a Linux kernel to run containers.

      The kernel is provided by the 'containerization' dependency and should
      be automatically available at:
        #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/containerization/kernel/vmlinuz

      Run 'compote setup' to verify your installation.

      For more information:

      Compote uses Apple's Containerization framework to run Linux containers on macOS.

      Requirements:
        - macOS Sequoia (15.0) or later
        - Xcode 16.0 or later
        - Linux kernel (automatically downloaded on first run)

      Run 'compote setup' to verify your installation and download required components.
